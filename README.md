Pitchspock is an open source Android sound processing app.

The "pitchspock" GitHub repository contains the main building blocks of the app : java files, resources and the manifest. To be able to use them, create a new Android project (e.g. via Eclipse) and copy/paste these building blocks (*.java, /res/*, AndroidManifest.xml) into the appropriate folders.  

Have fun!
